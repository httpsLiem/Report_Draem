# Report_Draem
 
This repository contains a Python implementation of DRAEM, a state-of-the-art model for visual surface anomaly detection. DRAEM combines reconstruction and classification to accurately identify anomalous regions in images. The model consists of an encoder-decoder architecture for reconstruction and a discriminator to classify the reconstructed image as normal or anomalous.
